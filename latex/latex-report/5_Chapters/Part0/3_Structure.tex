\section{The Organization of the Thesis}
%================================================================
In the first part of this thesis, we will introduce the theoretical background of this thesis. We go through the theory of supervised learning and optimization of parametric models in \autoref{chap:SupervisedLearning}. In \autoref{chap:QuantumComputing}, we present the fundamentals of quantum computing. Quantum machine learning, the intersection of the two former disciplines, is presented in \autoref{chap:QML}. We present various numerical methods for analyzing the models implemented in this thesis is detailed in \autoref{chap:TfA}. In part II, we go through aspects surrounding the implementation of various models and methods used in this thesis. These are implemented using Python together with Qiskit \cite{Qiskit}, an IBM made open-source Python framework for quantum computing. We present details of various experiments and subsequent results and discussion in part III. We finally conclude our analysis and discuss future studies in part IV.
