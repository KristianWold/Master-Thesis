The work in this thesis was conducted at the Centre for Integrative Neuroplasticity (CINPLA).

%Without some people, this thesis would not have been possible. I first want to express my gratitude towards my supervisors professor Gaute Einevoll, associate professor Joakim Sundnes and researcher Alexander Stasik. Thank you all for your great support, guidance and meaningful discussions. I have learned a lot about scientific processes and in great part thanks to you. Thank you Gaute for showing me the world of computational neuroscience.

% AT, for helping with the formalities
% JS, code reviews
% AS, expertise in the field has been invaluable
% GE, keeping the project focused and help with uncovering the fascinating aspects of the neuroscience behind it all

%Working from home during the Covid-19 outbreak has been a challenging experience, but I believe it in some ways has taught me a lot about discipline and communication. 

I would like to thank my friends and family, especially my parents for their unconditional support and love in my years as a student in physics and computational science. I would also like to express my gratitude towards my partner Oda for her endless support throughout my degree.
