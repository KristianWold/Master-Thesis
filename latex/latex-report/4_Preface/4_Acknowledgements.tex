I would first like to thank my supervisor, Morten Hjorth-Jensen, for providing me outstanding support, guidance and inspiration. You are always available for a talk about anything, anytime. For that, I am truly grateful.

I would like to thank my co-supervisor, Stian Bilek, for being a mentor and friend. Thank you for all the lengthy discussions we have and the invaluable insight you have helped me obtain.

From the deepest of my heart, I would like to thank my family, for their tireless support during hard times. Without you, this thesis would not be possible. I would also like to extend a special thanks to my brother, Anders Wold-Dobbe, for giving excellent insight into scientific writing and help with correction.

I would like to thank Overwatch Squad, our own discord server of friends, for helping me through these times of isolation due to the pandemic. Thank you for all the late nights and long talks.

Lastly, I would like to thank the computational physics group, for creating such a friendly environment and pleasant place to be. You have been very important to me, both academically and socially.
