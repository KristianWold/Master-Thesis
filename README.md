# Master-Thesis
This project is still in development. Bugs are still likely present and numerical results are not final.

## Overview
The aim of this thesis is to study parameterized quantum circuits used as machine learning models, optimized using gradient-based methods.

## Structure
The [latex folder](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/latex) contains the LaTeX source for building the thesis, as well as 
[figures](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/latex/figures) and 
[tables](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/latex/tables) generated in the analyses.

The [notebooks folder](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/notebooks) contains Jupyter notebooks used for generating 
[numerical data](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/notebooks/experiments) and 
[analysis](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/notebooks/analysis). A collection of notebooks containing 
[preliminary models](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/notebooks/prototypes) is also present.

The [notes folder](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/notes) contains notes on relevant scientific articles and reflections on the results produced in this project.

The [results folder](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/results) contains pickled models in 
[data](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/results/data), and generated plots in [figures](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/results/figures).

The [src folder](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/src) contains the source code. For details, see [src readme]().
