# Master-Thesis
This project is still in development. Bugs are still likely present and numerical results are not final.

## Overview
The aim of this thesis is to study parameterized quantum circuits used as machine learning models, optimized using gradient based methods.

## Structure
The [latex folder](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/latex) contains the LaTeX source for building the thesis, as well as 
[figures](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/latex/figures) and 
[tables](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/latex/tables) generated in the analyses.

The [notebooks folder](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/notebooks) contains Jupyter notebooks used for generating 
[numerical data](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/notebooks/experiments) and 
[analysis](https://github.com/KristianWold/Master-Thesis/tree/main/notebooks/analysis). A collection of notebooks containing 
[preliminary models]() is also present.
